# Matrix can be created atleast 2D Array we can fill them with zeores or ones or any specific numbers

import numpy as np

# arr = np.zeros((3,4)) # For Filling Up With All Zerores
# arr = np.ones((3,4)) # For Filling Up With All Ones
# arr = np.full((3,4),8) # For Filling Up With All specific number
# arr = np.eye((3)) # For Creating A diangonal in a matrices
arr = np.arange(1,10,2) # For Creating a Step Up Array


print(arr)
